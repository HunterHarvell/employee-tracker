## Installation and Deployment
You will first need to copy the code repository from https://github.com/HunterHarvell/employee-tracker.git, and install the dependencies for the application using the command `npm i` in your terminal. 

Once the dependencies have finished installing, log into mysql using the command `mysql -u root -p` and entering in your password when prompted. You'll then need to source the database schema and seed data using the mysql commands `SOURCE db/schema.sql` and `SOURCE db/seeds.sql`. This will setup the database and fill it with the starting information.

Quit mysql using the command `quit;`. Now you can run the server using the command `npm start`. You can now follow the prompts and UI to add, edit, and delete the data inside of the database.
